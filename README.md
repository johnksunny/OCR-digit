# OCR-digit

This project aims to perform a basic digit-OCR task with simple logistic regression first, and later using a single-layered neural network. 
The data set used contains 5000  20 x 20 pixel images of shoddily scrawled single digits. 4000 pictures are used for training and the remaining are used for cross validation.
The aim is to build a multiclass classifier that can identify the digit given a new image.
